/**
 * This package represents the celestial objects you can encounter in space.
 * This includes large-scale objects like nebulae, galaxies or solar systems and
 * smaller-scale objects like moons, planets, comets and asteroids.
 *
 * This package should be considered effectively final - unless there is a
 * drastic change in how astrophysicists categorize objects in space.

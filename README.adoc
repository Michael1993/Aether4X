= Aether4X

A clone of http://aurora2.pentarch.org[Aurora], written in Java.

== Goals
I aim to create a highly modular clone of Aurora, meaning it should be fairly simple to:

 * Replace the data.
 * Replace the UI.
 * Replace some gameplay rules.
Aether should also be able to load additional game logic/data and merge it with it's base.
 
The current plan is to use (for the default implementation):

 * https://www.postgresql.org[PostGreSQL] for data that doesn't change (i.e.: Space object data).
 * https://www.json.org[JSON] for data subject to change (i.e.: game data).
 * https://github.com/google/gson[GSON] for JSON serialization.
 * https://openjfx.io[JavaFX] for UI.
